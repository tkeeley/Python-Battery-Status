# Python Battery Status
 Run this script to show current status of your battery
 
I'm on a Mac and don't have my battery status in the top bar so I set an alias to quickly run this in terminal to check my battery status. I also used PyMsgBox to handle the alert boxes that pop up to show the status.

Uses PyMsgBox for the alert box and psutil to get the battery status.
 
 ```
 pip install PyMsgBox
  ```
   ```
 pip install psutil
  ```
